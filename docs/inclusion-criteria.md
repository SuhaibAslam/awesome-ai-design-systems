# Inclusion Criteria

A project should satisfy at least one:
- Explicitly designed for AI, LLM, or agent interfaces
- Generates UI from AI outputs or schemas
- Treats prompts or agents as first-class UI entities
- Provides reusable system-level primitives

Not included:
- Generic UI kits without AI-specific intent
- Traditional design systems with minor AI features
- One-off demos without reusable structure
- Pure marketing tools without artifacts
- General-purpose app frameworks without AI-native intent

When in doubt, open an issue and provide evidence for inclusion.
